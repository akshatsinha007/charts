## Introduction
 Scoop is a feature of Devtron designed to enhance the management and monitoring of Kubernetes clusters. Its primary use cases include:
 - **Monitoring Pod Restarts**: Track and view details of application pod restarts, including information on pods, restart events, previous container logs, and node status.
 - **Event Tracking**: Observe and act on events across all Kubernetes resources in the cluster.
 - **Resource Caching**: Cache Kubernetes resources in the target cluster to reduce API fetch times when accessing resources from the browser.
